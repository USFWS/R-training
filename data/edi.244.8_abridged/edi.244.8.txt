      The United States Fish and Wildlife Service Delta Juvenile Fish Monitoring Program (DJFMP) has monitored juvenile Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha and other fish species within the San Francisco Estuary (Estuary) since 1976 using a combination of surface trawls and beach seines. Since 2000, three trawl sites and 58 beach seine sites have been sampled weekly or biweekly within the Estuary and lower Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers. As part of the Interagency Ecological Program (IEP) that manages the Estuary, the DJFMP has tracked the relative abundance and distribution of naturally and hatchery produced juvenile Chinook Salmon of all races as they outmigrate through the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta for over four decades. The data that DJFMP collected has been used not only to help inform the management of Chinook Salmon, but also to monitor the status of native species of interest such as the previously listed Sacramento Splittail Pogonichthys macrolepidotus and invasive species such as Mississippi Silverside Menidia beryllina and Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides.

          The Delta Juvenile Fish Monitoring Program (DJFMP) of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Lodi Office (formerly Stockton Office) contributes to the monitoring of fish species in the San Francisco Estuary, California as part of the Interagency Ecological Program (IEP) for the San Francisco Estuary. The DJFMP has been monitoring populations of juvenile Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha within the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta (Delta) and its watershed since 1976 (Dekar et al. 2013). Prior to 1992, DJFMP conducted annual monitoring between April and June to assess the effects of water operations on the inter- and intra-annual abundance and distribution of primarily juvenile fall-run Chinook Salmon within the Delta and lower Sacramento River. Following the listing of Sacramento River winter-run Chinook Salmon as endangered by the State of California in 1989 (CDFW 2005) and the National Marine Fisheries Service in 1994 (59 FR 440), DJFMP expanded the long-term sampling program to one that operated between October and June to collect more information on all races of juvenile Chinook Salmon in the San Francisco Estuary. The DJFMP was further expanded in 1995 to sample year-round, in part, to expand the temporal and geographic monitoring of resident fish and Central Valley Steelhead Oncorhynchus mykiss (Dekar et al. 2013). Today, year-round monitoring continues with an emphasis on populations of all races of Chinook Salmon in the Delta per the monitoring and reporting terms of the Biological Opinion and Conference Opinion on the Long-Term Operations of the Central Valley Project and State Water Project (NMFS 2009). Data collected by DJFMP are intended to provide general biological and demographic information that can be used to assess trends over time. Detailed methodology for the DJFMP is as follows.
          (1.) Data collection methods:
          BEACH SEINE: We use beach seines to evaluate the spatial distribution of fishes occurring in unobstructed shallow near-shore habitats (e.g., beaches and boat ramps ≤ 1.2 m in depth) throughout the lower Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers, the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, and the lower San Francisco Estuary. Beach seine sites are stratified into six geographic seine regions: (1) Lower Sacramento River, (2) North Delta, (3) Central Delta, (4) South Delta, (5) Lower San Joaquin River, and (6) San Francisco and San Pablo Bays. Seine regions are delineated by proximity to canals or water bypasses where fish may be diverted from historical migration routes. In this dynamic system, occasional changes in river flow or environmental conditions prevent sampling or make it necessary to temporarily relocate seine sites (e.g., tidal conditions, or submerged or floating aquatic vegetation blocking access to sites). If new seine sites were needed, we attempted to relocate the site to another location with similar habitat (e.g., hydrogeomorphic characteristics) that was less than 100 m from the original site.
Access to beach seine sites in the Lower San Joaquin River seine region can be difficult under certain conditions. Since 2000, when the discharge of the lower San Joaquin River dropped below 51 m3/s and boat access to the regular beach seine locations became difficult, replacement sites that were accessible from land were sampled instead (station codes: SJ065W, SJ070W, SJ074A, SJ076W, SJ079E). 
Under normal conditions (staff available, no obstructions at site, etc.), we conduct beach seine sampling once a week at each site for all seine regions except the Lower San Joaquin River and the San Francisco and San Pablo Bays regions. Beach seine sites within the Lower San Joaquin River Region were generally sampled once a week from January 1 to July 31 and once every two weeks from August 1 to December 31. The beach seine sites located within the San Francisco and San Pablo Bays Region were generally sampled once every two weeks due to the low occurrence of fish species of management concern at this area.
          LIBERTY ISLAND BEACH SEINE: From 2002 to 2005, the DJFMP conducted a pilot field study at Liberty Island, a restoring wetland in the northern portion of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta that resulted from a levee breach, to determine how fish community structure is affected by the vegetation colonization and expansion in the region. Five years later, DJFMP conducted additional beach seine sampling from March 2010 through February 2013 under the BREACH III agreement with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. Since 2013, field sampling at Liberty Island has been integrated into DJFMP’s beach seine monitoring program to provide baseline data that can serve as a reference site for future restoration efforts at Liberty Island and other sites in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. 
A total of 21 fixed sites, distributed among four quadrants within Liberty Island (northwest, northeast, southwest, and southeast quadrants), are sampled monthly (10–11 sites per trip, two trips per month). Ten sites were selected from locations previously sampled during the pilot study in 2002–2005 within the southern quadrants of Liberty Island. In 2010, eleven new sites were selected in the northern quadrants of Liberty Island to maximize spatial coverage. Liberty Island was broken up into four quadrants based on habitat types and exposure: station code LI number 1-5 are located in the southern quadrants whereas those numbered 6-11 are located in the northern quadrants; eastern and western quadrants are indicated by E and W at the end of station code names, respectively. The southern quadrants of Liberty Island are tidally influenced but remain inundated at low tide (station code LI number 1 to 5). The southeast quadrant of Liberty Island is susceptible to the effects of wind and wave erosion, whereas the southwest quadrant is more protected from those effects and tends to have more submerged aquatic vegetation. The northern quadrants of Liberty Island are heavily influenced by tide and are mostly characterized by exposed mudflats at low tide with a few channels and areas of inundation less than a meter. The northern quadrants have immense stands of emergent vegetation as well as large areas of submerged aquatic vegetation. Erosion due to wind and wave processes is limited to the southeast corner of the northeast quadrant of Liberty Island. Vegetation expansion and site erosion have greatly reduced our ability to conduct beach seine sampling in many sites within the Liberty Island region starting around 2016.
          MIDWATER AND KODIAK TRAWLS: We use surface trawls to examine the relative abundance of fishes migrating into and out of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. Trawl sites are located at the entry (Sacramento and Mossdale trawl sites) and exit (Chipps Island trawl Site) points of juvenile Chinook Salmon to the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. 
We sample at trawl sites using Kodiak (KDTR) and mid-water (MWTR) trawls. The program exclusively uses a MWTR at the Chipps Island Trawl Site and a KDTR at the Mossdale Trawl Site. At the Sacramento Trawl Site (also called Sherwood Harbor), the program used MWTR exclusively prior to 1994, and has used a KDTR from October to March and a MWTR from April to September after 1994. The KDTR has been used in place of the MWTR at the Sacramento Trawl Site from October to March to maximize the capture of larger Chinook Salmon (Dekar et al. 2013). In general, each trawl site is sampled three days per week, ten tows per day, throughout the year. Trawl sites are generally sampled on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday each week throughout the field season to maximize temporal coverage. Between April and June, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) conduct sampling at the Mossdale trawl Site instead of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) using the same procedure. Data collected by both the USFWS and CDFW at the Mossdale Trawl Site are included in this dataset.
During each sampling day, we attempted ten 20-minute tows between approximately 7am and 1pm at all trawl sites (night sampling did take place in previous years). All tows are conducted mid-channel and facing upstream at the Sacramento and Mossdale trawl sites, which constitute a reach length of approximately 6.5 km and 3 km, respectively. In contrast, tows were generally conducted facing either upstream or downstream in the north, south, and middle portions of the channel at the Chipps Island Trawl Site depending on tide direction and flow. The Chipps Island Trawl Site constitutes a reach length of approximately 4 km. The MWTR and KDTR nets are towed by one and two boats, respectively, in the top few meters of the water column at a speed necessary and distance apart (for KDTR) to ensure that the net mouth remained fully extended and submerged. The measure of the distance traveled during each tow was recorded using a calibrated mechanical flow meter (General Oceanics, Model #2030) deployed alongside the boat. 
At the end of each MWTR tow, the net is retrieved by the towing vessel using a winch to collect all the fishes observed in the cod end. For KDTR net retrieval, the two towing vessels (i.e., net and chase boats) would maneuver alongside each other and the chase boat would transfer its tow rope to the net boat. Subsequently, the crew on the chase boat would travel downstream to the live box connected to the KDTR, retrieve, secure, and pull the live box from the water into the boat. All fishes collected from the cod end or live box are placed in a holding container filled with water for processing. Lastly, the crew would determine the condition of each tow as either “normal” (defined as no twists, snags, or tears in the net, little to no [<5%] debris in/on the net, and no [<5%] blockage between the mouth of the net to the live box), “fair” (defined as partial twists, snags, or small tears in the net, some [5–25% coverage] debris in/on the net, or partial [5–25%] blockage between the mouth of the net to the live box), or “poor” (defined as complete twists, snags, or large tears in the net, heavy [>25% coverage] debris in/on the net, or near complete [>25%] blockage between the mouth of the net to the live box).
          FISH HANDLING: Generally, we identify all fish in each sample that were ≥ 25 mm fork length (FL) to species or race, with the exception of five species that are readily identified at ≥ 20 mm FL: Sacramento Splittail Pogonichthys macrolepidotus, Three-spine Stickleback Gasterosteus aculeatus, Western Mosquitofish Gambusia affinis, Rainwater Killifish Lucania parva, and Sacramento Sucker Catostomus occidentalis. Prior to release at the site of capture, we measure fish to the nearest 1 mm FL. If greater than 50 individuals of a Chinook Salmon race, as designated by the river length-at-capture-date criteria (LDC, see paragraph below), or other species listed under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) are captured, a subsample of 50 individuals is randomly measured for FL and the rest are counted and not measured (referred to as a “plus count”). For non-listed species, if greater than 30 individuals of a non-listed species are captured, a subsample of 30 individuals is randomly measured for FL and the rest are counted and not measured. Fish that could not be accurately identified in the field are preserved and brought back to the laboratory. The identification of preserved fishes is then confirmed with the use of dichotomous keys and/or with the aid of a microscope.
The race of all unmarked juvenile Chinook Salmon (i.e., no adipose fin clip to indicate that it is a hatchery fish) was determined using the river LDC developed by Fisher (1992) and modified by Greene (1992). The assumptions associated with the river LDC for the Sacramento-San Joaquin River basin are that (1) spawning of fall-run Chinook Salmon occurs between October 1–December 31, (2) spawning of late fall-run Chinook Salmon occurs between January 1–April 15, (3) spawning of winter-run Chinook Salmon occurs between April 16–August 15, (4) spawning of spring-run Chinook Salmon occurs between August 16–September 30, and that (5) the growth rates of fish are identical among all Chinook Salmon races (Fisher 1992). Although one or more of these assumptions are likely violated (Fisher 1994; Yoshiyama et al. 1998), the river LDC is currently widely used by managers, and is the only cost effective and logistically feasible way to differentiate between the different races of juvenile Chinook Salmon in the field. Fisher (1994) noted that Chinook Salmon races within the Central Valley do appear to spawn at distinctly separate time periods except for fall- and spring-run due to the loss of headwater habitats (e.g., resulting from dams), forced coexistence, and subsequent hybridization within the Sacramento River basin (Banks et al. 2000; Greig et al. 2003; Banks et al. 2014). As a result, many of the Chinook Salmon characterized as spring-run by the river LDC may actually be fall-run. We use the river LDC to differentiate between unmarked winter-run, spring-run, fall-run, and late fall-run sized juvenile Chinook Salmon. The race designations used in this dataset should be considered a rough approximation and not interpreted as definitive. 
Juvenile Chinook Salmon with missing (clipped) adipose fins are considered marked fish. Fish possessing other forms of marks or tags (e.g., stain dye, disc tags, acoustic tags) are included within this dataset, but only classified to either acoustic tag or others (including various colors of stain dyes, disc tags, etc.). All clipped juvenile Chinook Salmon observed in recent years are considered hatchery-reared and were brought back to the laboratory for coded wire tag retrieval in order to acquire information on hatchery origin and release location. 
          WATER QUALITY: Water quality measurements are taken with YSI PRO 2030 Meter before or after each fish sample. We record temperature to the nearest 0.1˚C, dissolved oxygen to the nearest 0.01 mg/L, and conductivity to the nearest 0.01 micro siemen (µS). A Hach 2100Q Turbidity Meter is used to measure turbidity to the nearest 0.01 Nephelometric Turbidity Unit. At trawl sites, Secchi disk is also used measure water clarity.
          (2.) Datasheet: Datasheet, standard operating procedure, and metadata Microsoft Word document are all available upon request (email data contact).
          (3.) Instruments and equipment:
          BEACH SEINE: The beach seine net used by the DJFMP is a 15.2 m x 1.3 m seine net with 15.9 kg Delta 0.3 cm2 mesh and a 1.3 m x 1.3 m bag.  Each net has a float line and lead line attached to 1.8 m-long wooden poles at each end.
          MIDWATER TRAWL: The MWTR net used at the Sacramento Trawl Site is composed of six panels, each decreasing in mesh size towards the cod end. The mesh size for each panel ranged from 20.3 cm stretch at the mouth to 0.6 cm stretch just before the cod end. The cod end was composed of 0.3 cm weave mesh. The fully extended mouth size was 4.15 x 5.0 m. Two depressors and hydrofoils enable the net to remain at the top few meters of the water column while sampling. Depressors were made of 0.7 cm thick stainless steel (one on each side of the net lead line) and are attached to the net with shackles to extend the bottom line of the mouth. Hydrofoils were made of 0.7 cm thick aluminum plates with split floats (one on each side of the net float line) and are attached to the net with shackles to extend the top of the net at the water surface. On each side of the net, the depressor and hydrofoil are connected to the boat using a 30.5 m Amsteel rope bridle (0.64 cm diameter). The net is fished approximately 30 m behind the boat. 
The MWTR net used at the Chipps Island Trawl Site is larger but similar in construction to the MWTR net used at the Sacramento trawl site. There are five panels, each with decreasing mesh size towards the cod end. The mesh size for each panel ranged from 10.2 cm stretch at the mouth to 2.5 cm stretch just before the cod end. The cod end was composed of 0.8 cm knotless material. The fully extended mouth size of the Chipps Island MWTR net is 7.64 by 9.65 m. The depressors and hydrofoils of the Chipps Island MWTR are larger and connected to the boat in the same way as those on the Sacramento MWTR. On each side of the net, the depressor and hydrofoil are connected to the boat using a 30.5 m Amsteel rope bridle (0.6 cm diameter) attached to a 15.2 m tow rope (0.95 cm diameter). The Chipps Island MWTR net is fished approximately 45 m behind the boat. 
The measure of the distance traveled during each tow was recorded using a calibrated mechanical flow meter (General Oceanics, Model #2030) deployed alongside the boat. We estimated volume sampled by each trawl by calculating the difference between the end and starting value of the flow meter, and multiplying it by the factory-stated K calibration factor (0.026873) and the trawl net mouth area. Because the MWTR nets do not open completely while under tow and net mouth dimensions vary within and among tows (USFWS 1993), previously quantified estimates of mean net mouth area are used. The mean net mouth area for MWTR nets used for the Chipps Island and Sacramento trawl sites were obtained from 3–4 physical measurements taken while sampling and were reported as 18.58 m2 and 5.08 m2, respectively (USFWS 1993). 
          KODIAK TRAWL: KDTRs are conducted with two vessels; a chase boat and a net boat.  The KDTR nets used at the Mossdale and Sacramento trawl sites are composed of five panels, each decreasing in mesh size towards a live box at the cod end.  The mesh size for each panel ranges from 5.1 cm stretch at the mouth to 0.3 cm stretch just before the live box. The live box (36 cm wide x 36 cm tall x 49 cm long) is composed of 0.18 cm thick aluminum that is perforated with numerous 0.46 cm diameter holes. The live box contains several internal baffles to minimize fish mortality and stress due to flow pressure. The fully extended mouth size of the KDTR net is 1.83 x 7.62 m. A float line and lead line enabled the net to remain at the top few meters of the water column while sampling.  In addition, at the front of each wing of the net is a 1.83 m spreader bar with floats at the top and weights at the bottom to keep depth constant while sampling. The KDTR net is connected to the boats using a 2.3 m rope bridle (2.4 cm diameter) attached to a 30.5 m tow rope (0.95 cm diameter) on each side of the net. The net is fished approximately 31 m from the boats. The measure of the distance traveled during each tow was recorded using a calibrated mechanical flow meter (General Oceanics, Model #2030) deployed alongside the boat. Volume sampled by each KDTR is estimated by calculating the difference between the end and starting value of the flow meter, and multiplying it by the factory-stated K calibration factor (0.026873) and the trawl net mouth area.  The mean net mouth area for KDTR nets used for the Mossdale and Sacramento trawl sites was estimated to be 12.54 m2 based on the program’s 1995 annual report (USFWS 1998).
          WATER QUALITY: The YSI PRO 2030 Meter is used to measure water quality parameters such as temperature, dissolved oxygen, and conductivity. The Hach 2100Q Turbidity Meter is used to measure turbidity. At trawl sites, a Secchi disk is also used measure water clarity.
          (4.) Analysis and methods (standard operating procedures): Data is in its original form and no catch per effort calculations have been made. Standard operating procedures for methods and quality checks are available upon request.
          (5.) Project history (change in methods and locations):
Modifications to all fish sampling (trawls and beach seines) are made regularly to improve data accuracy, adhere to permit limitations, and accommodate safety conditions and/or special studies. 
          PROGRAM-WIDE CHANGES:
          1977-1992: Before August 1st 1977, all Chinook Salmon captured were measured and fork lengths recorded.  Between August 1st 1977 and July 31st 1992, only fifty Chinook Salmon from each sample taken were measured and those not measure were recorded as a total sum, minus those measured.  
          1992: After August 1st 1992, fifty individuals from each race of Chinook Salmon were measured and those not measured were summed and assigned a count reference number to associate with measured Chinook Salmon.  
          1995: Since July of 1995, fish shorter than 25 mm FL are considered to be too small to be accurately identified in the field and as such are not recorded. Exceptions to this are: Sacramento Splittail Pogonichthys macrolepidotus, Three-spine Stickleback Gasterosteus aculeatus, Western Mosquitofish Gambusia affinis, Rainwater Killifish Lucania parva, and Sacramento Sucker Catostomus occidentalis, which are considered identifiable down to 20 mm FL in the field.
          1995: The DJFMP was further expanded in 1995 to sample year-round, in part, to expand the temporal and geographic monitoring of resident fish and Central Valley Steelhead Oncorhynchus mykiss.
          1996: Temperatures were recorded on datasheets in Celsius instead of Fahrenheit. Previous Fahrenheit data were converted into Celsius in the database.
          2006: Gear condition code 4 began to be entered into the database on August 1st 2006 (not included in this dataset). Condition code 4 indicates that site was visited, but could not be sampled.
          2007: See note on 1992 changes to Chinook Salmon race assignment. After August 1st 2007, the need for count reference numbers was eliminated as unmarked Chinook Salmon and their associated summed counts were automatically raced in the database.  
          2011: The program began taking turbidity, dissolved oxygen, and conductivity measurements on August 1st 2011 to provide environmental data.
          2019: Specific conductance is used instead of un-specified conductivity measurement. Unclear whether conductivity measurements in prior years were adjusted for temperature.
          Specific considerations for each fishing method/gear type are as follows and should be considered in analyses when using the dataset:
          BEACH SEINE:
          1978: Multiple Lower Sacramento River beach seine sites were moved from beaches to nearby boat ramps.
          1994: Beach seining was expanded to include San Joaquin River and South Delta regions.
          2000: Fish that cannot be identified easily to species are recorded as unidentified fish.
          2002-2005: Pilot study at Liberty Island.
          2004: Sampling at Grayson site (SJ087W) was discontinued for safety reasons.
          2007: Beginning in 2007, Stump Beach site (SR012E) is replaced by Sandy Beach site (SR012W).
          2013: Beach seining was expanded to include Liberty Island. Several new beach seine stations at Liberty Island were added.
          TRAWLS:
          1976-1981: Trawl sampling the Sacramento River (i.e., Sacramento Trawl Site) was conducted at Clarksburg instead of the current Sherwood Harbor (precursor to current Sherwood Harbor location). 
          1976-1986: No start or end values recorded for flow meters, only calculated difference between two values were entered into database. 
          1985: Net dimensions and flow meter values started being recorded for catch per cubic meter calculations to determine the volume of water sampled.
          1990: Midwater trawl was conducted at Hood location in February and March for a special study.
          1994: Kodiak trawls started to be used regularly at the Sacramento Trawl Site near Sherwood Harbor to allow the capture of the larger, less abundant races of juvenile Chinook Salmon.
          1996: Began the recording of flow meter gear ID to document the differences in K factors across flow meters.
          1998: Adult salmon and steelhead counted, but not measured to reduce handling stress. Length was estimated visually and documented as either >500 mm or >300 mm.
          2001: Larger mesh trawl nets (8 mm) used consistently at Chipps Island site for midwater trawls. Previously, several trawl nets with smaller mesh sizes (6.3 mm) were used intermittently at Chipps Island.
          2001: Benicia, an alternate location for Chipps Island site, was used briefly to reduce take of the endangered Delta Smelt. 
          2006: Starting on October 6th 2006, small wires has been used to secure flow meters during trawls to reduce turbulence and improve flow meter accuracy.
          2008: Benicia, an alternate location for Chipps Island site, was used briefly to reduce take of the endangered Delta Smelt. 
          2011: In fall of 2011, sampling effort at Chipps Island was curtailed to limit catch of the endangered Delta Smelt Hypomesus transpacificus.
          2013: Gear condition code 9 began to be entered into the database on April 1st 2013. Condition code 9 indicates that a fish cannot be assigned to a specific tow (e.g., fish was gilled in trawl net and therefore not processed at the end of proper tow in the cod end of the net).
          (6.) QA/QC: 
          METHODS: Starting in 2001, the program has had a dedicated fish biologist that is responsible for training field personnel in fish identification and implementing a field Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC) program.  The QA/QC program consists of testing the field crew using preserved and wild specimens at least twice a year, reviewing preserved fish samples that are brought back from the field, and accompanying field personnel when sampling to assure correct identification of the fish species.  All personnel are trained following standard operating procedures (SOP) for field sampling during their first week of employment and then work with experienced employees for the first 3 months of their employment.  Our current protocol states that any fish the field crew has difficulty identifying are to be brought back to the office to ensure correct identification.
The YSI PRO 2030 Meter instrument is calibrated daily and if a calibration fails, the instrument would no longer be used until the necessary repairs have been made. The Hach 2100Q Turbidity Meter is checked and calibrated every three months and is replaced when needed. 
          DATA: Data is entered into Microsoft Access form with customized error-checking and data validation checks. Prior to 2017, data QA/QC was done by having a crew member compare the original field data sheet with the entered data line-by-line to ensure that the values in the field datasheet and the database match. The program initiated a new data QA/QC protocol in 2017 in which data is entered twice into two separate databases and then followed by a custom query that attempt to match the two datasets. When a mismatch is found, the field data sheet is reviewed and errors are corrected in the main and/or the duplicate database.
          (7.) Contractor information: All fish identification and water quality measures are conducted by the field staff of the Delta Juvenile Fish Monitoring Program, Lodi Fish and Wildlife Office, United States Fish and Wildlife Service. 
          (8.) External review process: There is no external review process.
