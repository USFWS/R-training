## Data types
```{r}
# numeric:
x <- 5
```

```{r}
# string or character:
y <- "CHN"
```

```{r}
# Boolean:
w <- TRUE
!w
```

```{r}
# factor (kind of like a hybrid of numeric and string):
my_factor <- factor(x=c("a","b","c"), 
                    levels=c("a","b","c"), 
                    ordered=TRUE)
my_factor
```


## Data structures

A **vector** is a collection of like-objects:
```{r}
# a vector of strings:
x <- c("a","b","c")

# a vector of numbers:
y <- c(1,2,3)
```

A **data frame** is like a spreadsheet, e.g., it has rows and columns:
```{r}
my_df <- data.frame("field_1"=1:3, "field_2"=4:6, "field_3"=7:9)
my_df
```

A **list** is similar to a vector except the objects don't have to be of the same type:
```{r}
my_list <- list(1, "a", c(5:9), my_df)
my_list
```

## Functions

A function is a set of code that has a name and zero or more parameters You run the 
function using its name and you pass in objects (e.g., numbers, strings, data frames) 
as arguments. Note that some parameters are required and some are optional meaning they 
have default values (if you don't set them explicitly, the default values are used). The 
help page for a given function will indicate which parameters are required and which 
have default values. If a function has parameter(s), arguments can generally be passed in according to the parameter name(s) and/or the argument positions. 

**Example**

The mean() function returns the arithmetic mean of a vector of numbers. It has three 
parameters called `x`, `trim`, and `na.rm` (plus an option for additional parameters that we 
don't need here). The parameter `x` takes the vector of numbers and is required, `trim` 
controls the number of observations that are trimmed from each end of `x` before the mean is 
computed (if you want that behavior) and has a default value of 0, and `na.rm` is a Boolean 
indicating whether any `r NA` values should be removed before the mean is computed and has 
a default of `r FALSE`.

If we're only using the first parameter, we can choose whether or not to use the name x:
```{r}
mean(x=1:3)
mean(1:3)
```

If you want to set all three parameters, you can omit names if they're in the original 
order:
```{r}
mean(x=c(0,NA,1,2,3,4), trim=1, na.rm=TRUE)
mean(c(0,NA,1,2,3,4), 1, TRUE)

# This would produce an error because mean() expects the first argument to be a numeric vector:
# mean(TRUE, c(0,NA,1,2,3,4), 1)
```

If you want to go out of order or you want to set some and use default values for others, you'll usually want to include parameter names:
```{r}
mean(na.rm=TRUE, x=c(0,NA,1,2,3,4), trim=1)
mean(x=c(0,NA,1,2,3,4), na.rm=TRUE)
```

When in doubt, use parameter names.

The material presented here uses functions from external packages. When using these 
functions we use the notation `libraryName::functionName()`, e.g., `dplyr::select()`, so 
it's clear where the function is coming from.
